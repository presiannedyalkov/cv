# Profile
profile:
  career: |
    I am a web developer with a passion for creating usable applications pragmatically. Versed in Agile practices, I use different approaches to get work done. At the center of all my considerations is the end-user perspective, and I always aim to understand the value the business is creating for them. From a developer’s perspective, I am adamant that the coding process should be kept neat, following Clean Code practices. Drawing a direct connection between business logic, business requirements and application code is critical for application optimization, so I engage in proactive communication with the relevant stakeholders. With a decade of coding experience, I bring with me a multitude of languages and tools, as well as a deep understanding of the underlying business operations dictating the application's business logic. Always trying to see the big picture, I am capable of assessing the tasks at hand and their immediate and future value for the business. I divide my spare time between creative enterprises and learning new things. I approach problems with a smile and I strive to create meaningful and valuable connections with people.
